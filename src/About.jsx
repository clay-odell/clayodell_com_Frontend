      <h2>Clay O'Dell's Biography</h2>
      <div className="biography" >
        <p className="bio-paragraph">
          Born in the early 1980s in Huntsville, Alabama, Clay O'Dell is the son
          of a retired middle school teacher and an attorney who would later
          rise to the ranks of district and circuit court judge. Early on, Clay
          was captivated by sports, leading him to become an All-Metro football
          player in 1999 for his high school team, which wen 10-0 during its
          regular season. However, as he grew older and thanks to English
          teachers such as Julie Culpepper and Becky McDowell, his passions
          shifted to music and literature. This led him to earn a bachelor's
          degree in English from the University of Alabama in 2003, and a
          master's degree in secondary English education from Columbus State
          University in 2009. Following a decade-long career in the music
          industry and ten years of experience as an English teacher at both the
          secondary and post-secondary levels, Clay has always been committed to
          education. However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought significant
          uncertainty to his career in music. Embracing change, Clay enrolled in
          Auburn University's Office of Professional and Continuing Education's
          Software Engineering Bootcamp in 2024. After completing the rigorous
          certificate program, Clay is now on the lookout for roles as a
          software engineer, developer, or technical writer. He is eager to
          apply the diverse skills he has honed over his eclectic career to new
          challenges and opportunities.
